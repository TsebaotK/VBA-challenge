# VBA-challenge

I created a VBA script that loops through every worksheet of the “Multipe_year_stock_data” and the “alphabetical_testing” excel files. 
 My script calculates the yearly price change by deducting the opening price from the closing price by ticker. Then, it calculates the percentage change and gives the total stock volume of a stock. Finally, it returns the stock with the greatest increase, decrease, and total volume.
It also has conditional formatting that changes the cell colors of the negative and positive yearly and percent changes to red and green.
